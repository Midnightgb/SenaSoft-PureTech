# SENASoft 2024 Project Framework

[Ver en Español](./WORK_FRAMEWORK_ES.md)

## 1. Technology Stack
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
- Frontend: Vue.js
- Database: Supabase with PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Render

## 2. Architecture
- Approach: API-First Design with Layered Architecture
- Layers:
  1. Presentation: Vue.js (Frontend)
  2. Business Logic: FastAPI (Backend)
  3. Data: Supabase/PostgreSQL

## 4. Methodology: Scrumban
- Scrum elements:
  - Short sprints
  - Daily stand-ups
  - Reviews at the end of each sprint
- Kanban elements:
  - Visual board (Trello) with columns:
    - To Do
    - In Progress
    - Review
    - Done

## 5. Workflow
1. Initial API design with FastAPI
2. Iterative development in short sprints
3. Constant updating of the Kanban board
4. Daily reviews and end-of-sprint reviews
5. Continuous integration between frontend and backend
6. Continuous deployment to Render

## 6. Version Control (Git)
- Main branch: `master`
- Development branch: `develop`
- Feature branches: `feature/*`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/*`
- Use of GitHub Actions for auto-merge of completed features

## 7. Development Process
1. Create a new branch from `develop` for each feature/bugfix
2. Develop and make frequent commits
3. Perform local testing
4. Create a Pull Request to `develop`
5. Code review by peers (if possible in the context of the competition)
6. Merge to `develop` (automatic if using the keyword in the commit  "`[ready for deploy]`")
7. Automatic deployment to Render from `develop` 

## 8. Deployment (Render)
- Frontend:
  1. Create a new Static Site in Render
  2. Connect with GitHub repository
  3. Configure:
     - Build Command: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
     - Publish Directory: `frontend/dist`
- Backend:
  1. Create a new Web Service in Render
  2. Connect with GitHub repository
  3. Configure:
     - Root Directory: `backend`
     - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
 
## 9. Key Deliverables
- Source code on GitHub (frontend and backend)
- API documentation (generated by FastAPI)
- Functional database in Supabase
- Application deployed and accessible on Render
- Kanban board with progress history
- Final project presentation

## 10. Additional Considerations
- Focus on code quality and best practices
- Attention to user experience (UX/UI)
- Implementation of tests (unit, integration)
- Clear documentation of the process and decisions made
- Configuration of environment variables in Render for Supabase credentials

## 11. Generating Backend Requirements
We use `pip freeze` to generate the `requirements.txt` file for the backend. To generate the requirements, run the following command in the backend directory:

if you are on the root directory of the project, you can run the following command:
```
cd backend && pip freeze > requirements.txt && cd ..
```
or if you are already in the backend directory, you can run the following command:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This command will scan the backend code and generate a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies for the project.
